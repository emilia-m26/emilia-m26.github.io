# [CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project]

I was very excited to do my Gem Project.  Even before reading the requirements, I was already imagining what type of website to scrape, how to design the program to work, and all that good stuff.  I love to travel so I knew my project had to be about traveling! 

For my CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project, I decided to scrape information from "The Atlas Obscura Guide To Brazil" (https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/brazil).  This site has information from many different countries but I chose Brazil as I have a great love for Brazil's culture and language.  I chose to scrape information from the Attractions and Gastronomy sections of the website.  I assumed at first that I would scrape each category, iterate through the information, and create two classes to separate concerns. I sketched out how I wanted the program to flow.  I drew on notebook paper from the beginning box and then how each section would branch out.

When I started inspecting the website further, I realized that the page only listed 16 items on a page, at a time. Which would mean I would need to scrape several pages to get all the information I originally planned for.   I mentioned this to my instructor and he advised that I focus on scraping the first page of both categories (attractions and gastronomy) and then if time allowed, to cotninue into the others. Besides that change, I was able to stick to the plan I originally drew out for the gem.

Before beginning any coding, I watched the Walkthrough videos provided for the project and also watched my cohort's study group videos providing information on the project.  I have to say, I am grateful I watched the videos before.  However, even with watching the videos and taking thorough notes beforehand I hit some pretty tough moments in creating the gem.  After watching Avi's walkthrough video of Daily Deals,  I decided I would take that approach as he also started with the suggestion to "make a plan", and had an organization that resonated with my own natural way of processing.  

With this project process, I learned there is not one solution to creating a CLI gem. There really is tons of trial and error when creating it, and while your "fake code" setup may work smoothly in the beginning, don't get overly excited or too attached to having it function in that manner only.  News Flash:  Eventually it will break! And no, it doesn't mean you aren't learning the conepts.  It is part of the process. 

My brazil_experience gem is set up to start with a welcome and ask you to make a choice: attractions, gastronomy, or exit.  I set up this menu (main_menu) with a case statement and it flowed smoothly.  I really thought I'd be able to get the rest working just as smoothly.  Nope! As I began putting in different options (main menu, exit, please try again) and add in the scraped data, it broke more often.  It really made sense to me at that moment that more code means more bugs.

Overall, the process of creating the CLI Data Gem was very interesting and definitely challenging. I did enjoy it and learned a lot from it. I had so many new errors, I now know how to fix errors I knew nothing about before! Lol. But, in all honesty, the biggest learned lessons were: commit as often as you can (I lost a page of code and that was not fun to replicate), don't get hung up on having to use a specific structure because as your data changes and your program grows - so will your code, and have fun.  It is not the end of the world if the code does not work.  You found one way it doesn't, there are a million other ways it can.
