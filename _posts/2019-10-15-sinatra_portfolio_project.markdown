> “The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.”
― Alan Kay


Disastrous, defined as *causing great damage* , would be the perfect description for what has been happening in the process of learning with Flatiron School. I am beginning week 9 and have submitted my second portfolio project, and the two words I will use to describe the overall process of this second module are: grueling and inspiring.  Yes, you read that correctly --*grueling AND inspiring*.  You may be wondering, how exactly can something be both? 

Let me attempt to explain...

While working through the first module and respective portfolio project, many times I wondered if this was really for me.  It was the equivalent of following the white rabbit, meeting Morpheus, and then being asked the million dollar question: Will you choose the Red Pill or the Blue Pill?

And, of course, I chose the Red Pill -- to dive into this fulltime software engineering program even though I already felt it was overwhelming and a huge challenge.

The grueling part of this process is the shift in mentality.  Once you take the Red Pill -- you are hit with hard truths that you will have to mentally adjust to or you will not handle the realities that are given to you.  When you make the decision to take that pill, you are saying you are ready to learn, adjust, be flexible, and keep pushing no matter how hard it gets. 

During the Sinatra project, I ran into some complications with Github, my local environment, and coding limitation. I had a vision for my web app project and I was determined to complete it.  But what happened was my coding knowledge limited me to not being able to complete it the way I wanted to.  This was a struggle for me, as a creative person, because creativity does not like to be limited. Frustrations arose when I had a great design in mind but was unable to produce what I envisioned. *(On a side note, what I envisioned was beyond the project scope so I was putting pressure on myself, not the project itself.)*


The inspiring part of this process is the shift in mentality.  Wait... What?  Didn't I just say the shift in mentality is what is grueling?  Yep, sure did.  And it is also inspiring! On the flip side of the grueling and onerwhelmed feelings, are feelings of optimism and enthusiam.  Because at this moment, with the knowledge I've gained in only 9 weeks I am actually able to create a pretty decent web app, and I've crossed into a realm of extreme potential.  While I may not be able to learn code with a quick download as Neo would have done in the Matrix; I can continue on this learning journey and add more to my skill set.  And the inspiring part?  If I can do so much with the little bit of knowledge I have now... Can you imagine the possibilities to create and develop as I add more skills into my knowledge-base?
