Recently, I completed my final project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering program.  It was created with React-Redux and Rails backend, the project is called {explore.}.  This app was created with the intention of allowing people to learn about different cultures through specific topics such as language, art, dance, and food.  The information is portayed via videos after choosing the specific country you liked to learn more about.
