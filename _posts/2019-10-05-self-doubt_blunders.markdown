>***“The master is a beginner that never gave up.”― Avina Celeste***
 
I was a complete newbie to coding.  My interest in the programming world stems from years ago, somehow always being involved in ERP implementations and helping business analysts understand our business processes, while I had to learn basics of programs so that both sides (IT and business) could come to a common ground, and function cohesively.  With repeated exposure to programming, testing, and implementations; I decided it was in my best interest to learn more about programming and also venture into a career change. *[Enter the Flatiron Journey]*

Today makes 7 weeks of being part of the Flatiron FT - Online Software Engineering program.  Next week we go into *#ProjectMode* for the Sinatra App project (portfolio project #2) and I am still as lost as when I first started!?!?  ... *Or Am I?*
	 
What I am starting to come to terms with is that most of the times, I am not as lost as I actually feel I am.  See... what happens is, that pesky Self-Doubt kicks in and stirs up the emotions! This causes a disconnect between what is actually happening, and what I perceive to be happening.

Learning any new skill, whether it's coding or a foreign language, places us in a situation to be vulnerable and to be a beginner once again.  I became familiar with this uncomfortable feeling, when a few years ago I decided to learn a new language.  I learned English and Spanish at the same time while growing up, as my family is from Puerto Rico and Spanish is their first language.  As a kid though, learning several things at once doesn't seem to phase us and the fact that we are young and aren't so self- conscious of the errors we make really helps along the learning process.

* We Learn
* We try on our own
* We make the mistakes
* Someone corrects us
* We accept the correction and adjust accordingly

And this cycle repeats itself, reinforcing the newly learned habits.  However, as adults we are much more conscious of the mistakes we make.  We also dislike the discomfort of being beginners once again. Messing up is not fun, we don't want to look like we don't know what we are doing, and if we don't get it we start to feel like *'maybe this isn't for me'*...

I remember starting to learn Brazilian Portuguese and there was a rush of excitement.  I always wanted to learn Brazilian Portuguese and finally having the opportunity to do so was a dream come true!  I was on cloud-nine for a while, especially because I was learning the new language with a foundation of Spanish which helped in the beginning stages.  As I proceeded through the language courses, of course the learning became more difficult and whenever a presentation came around... self-doubt came with it.

Being familiar with the feelings of self-doubt when placed in a position to present the skills learned, has not made self-doubt disappear while learning with Flatiron.  It does, however, give the upper-hand that I am able to identify what is really happening and I can make the decision to push past the self-doubt, the fears of making mistakes, and get to the other side.  **The only way to it, is through it!**

This is my reminder(to myself and to you), give yourself the chance to showcase your skills and take every opportunity to do so before going into project mode.  
* Pair with classmates and take turns explaining what's going on, this helps you and the classmate at the same time.  
* Get on the study group sessions and speak up.  Get used to making mistakes in front of others, many times they need the same questions answered.
* Say it ...  I don't understand!  Let those words become completely okay to say.  See, these words do not make us less than, they allow us to open ourselves to learning opportunities.
* Work through the coding challenges your instructor gives you and have it ready for the next 1:1.  Show them what you did and be completely open to their feedback.  Maybe you don't get it all right, but you 70% of it.  That's awesome!  It's progress and they can help you along the other 30% of the way.

And overall, remember -- We are Learning.  If we already knew the information, we wouldn't be here at Flatiron School.  We are beginners.  As difficult as it is, embrace the beginner status and the blank canvas we have been given.  We will create amazing opportunities for ourselves by pushing through the comfort zones.
