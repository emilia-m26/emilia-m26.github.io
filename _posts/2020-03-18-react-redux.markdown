While setting up the plans for my final project, I decided I wanted to display videos.  My project is called "explore."  The idea is to give a place where you can explore different countries and their cultures, specifically their language, food, art, and dance.  I wanted to use videos to display this information.

I looked up an npm packages for react and ran into Video-React.  I quickly skimmed through the information and decided to use that one once I arrived at displaying the videos, of course leaving the displaying of the video and its testing until all other parts of the project were completed.
