Debugging has never been so enjoyable, until I learned about breakpoints.  During one of our lectures on the Rails/Javascript module, our instructor (Nancy, which by the way is absolutely awesome!), showed a little tidbit that I had no idea I'd enjoy so much: debugging with breakpoints.

To access this magical tool, you would want to get into your Chrome Dev Tools (on Mac the shortcut would be cmd+opt+J which would open your console).  Once the console opens you can select different tabs.  To use breakpoints you would select the Source tab.  You would then click on your index.js file (or whichever .js file it is that you want to debug in).  Your view would like the screen above.  The green arrows are where I selected to break (or pause).
